# Portfolio

### Data analyses 
Analyses completed as part of my Graduate Diploma of Data Science are presented [here](https://josh-myers.github.io/road_deaths.html),  [here](https://josh-myers.github.io/electoral_survey.html) and [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_FBbVg83ztpqIlEdkmIXUKJOqPDMOteP). The first is an exploratory analysis of the Australian Road Deaths Database (with a nice animated plot), the second, a predictive and inferential study on the Australian Electoral Study survey data (toggle the 'code' buttons to show the R code), and the third, an inferential study on risk factors for ear infections in infants. 

I present an overview of my PhD project [here](https://josh-myers.github.io/PhD_project.html), with a more detailed presentation of one of the studies [here](https://josh-myers.github.io/R_Ordinal_Analysis.html).

### Web applications 
[This app](https://joshmyers.shinyapps.io/WAIPredictions/) implements the predictive models that I have developed during my PhD project (Myers et al. 2018a, 2018b, 2019a, 2019b, 2019c). It allows the user to query a model with a subject's test result by either uploading an XML file saved from a clinical device, or entering the values for the model variables directly. 

[This app](https://joshmyers.shinyapps.io/WAINorms/) serves as an interactive appendix that accompanies my Myers et al. (2019b) article. Users can choose various combinations of inputs to explore the data.

I developed [this app](https://joshmyers.shinyapps.io/UNHS_RiskCalculator/) for a research team at the University of Queensland.
